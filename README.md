# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that's vulnerable to database errors and situations where a requested user ID is invalid.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling. 

## Bug Description

The original code lacks proper error handling for database queries and cases where a user is not found. This can lead to server crashes or expose internal server errors to clients. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `bug.js`.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Access the `/users/:id` endpoint with an invalid user ID or simulate a database error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to gracefully handle errors by implementing proper error checking, informative error messages, and appropriate HTTP status codes.
